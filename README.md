# Weather Tunes
> *Because your music should match your mood...*

**Weather Tunes** is a web application that allows users to generate a Spotify playlist based on the user's local weather. The goal is for users to be able to listen to music that matches their surrounding's mood.

## How I Built It
The backend functionality was built using Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js and AJAX calls to the OpenWeatherMap API. The frontend was built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

## Video Walkthrough
Each user can:
- View Featured Artists on the Homepage
- Enter their city and state to get a playlist
- Change their city and state to get a new playlist
- Visit the artist pages to learn more about each playlist

## Notes

This was my first time web application for a class project. This was a very exciting project for me, as it was my first time integrating API calls into my own software and interacting with open source tools that others have created. 

Moving forward, I will not add new features to this application, as I plan to continue working on new projects instead.
